# RingFitMods-CronusZen
So after a while I finally got time to try out a new hardware called Cronus Zen which will let us adapt the Ring fit Adventure mods to console/PC games! This will be a collection of those .gpc scripts that can be adapted to the game the file is named after! The overall design of these scripts is to allow the user to exercise to play the game, just like Ring Fit Adventure. However in this case the ringcon isn't used so these will mostly deal with the running and squattinng portions of the mod. Each script does something similar to "to unlock your joystick you must jog/run IRL" and "squat to do an action". Some scripts will allow punching or swinging the Joy-Con in your hand for combat!
As per usual if you do end up using these scripts/mod on your project, YouTube, Twitch, Tiktok, etc, all you have to do is credit me. Don't be a jerk about it. Stealing or not crediting is a quick way to put things like this behind a paywall. And honestly, do you really want to deal with the consequences of stealing from a PoC content creator that puts their funds from projects like this into charity spaces?
