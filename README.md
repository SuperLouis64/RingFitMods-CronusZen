# RingFitMods-CronusZen
So after a while I finally got time to try out a new hardware called Cronus Zen which will let us adapt the Ring fit Adventure mods to console/PC games! This will be a collection of those .gpc scripts that can be adapted to the game the file is named after! The overall design of these scripts is to allow the user to exercise to play the game, just like Ring Fit Adventure. However in this case the ringcon isn't used so these will mostly deal with the running and squattinng portions of the mod. Each script does something similar to "to unlock your joystick you must jog/run IRL" and "squat to do an action". Some scripts will allow punching or swinging the Joy-Con in your hand for combat!
As per usual if you do end up using these scripts/mod on your project, YouTube, Twitch, Tiktok, etc, all you have to do is credit me. Don't be a jerk about it. Stealing or not crediting is a quick way to put things like this behind a paywall. Credit me on twitter [@SuperLouis_64](https://twitter.com/SuperLouis_64) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaG9FzEfuHkvh7J6W6MH4eA). 

## Hardware needed
- The Cronus Zen! Literally. That's it. You can grab one online for around $90-$130 depending on the source. Here is where I got mine on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3z7KrhJ)

## How to Set-up
- To set-up the hardware just follow the insturctions on the manual included in the Cronus Zen box. If you need more instructions visit the Cronus Zen's in depth manual on their [website](https://beta.cronusmax.com/). It's very straight forward and if needed there are plenty of YouTube videos out there that go over this. Fun fact, this hardware is used to help people practically aimbot or use macros in their favorite games. If the ring fit mod doesn't work out for you just become a pro in Fortnite or something!
- Make sure to download their software called [Zen Studio](https://www.cronusmax.com/downloads/). It will allow you to interact with the Cronus Zen and upload the .gpc scripts to them!


# How to Set-up the Scripts or Mods
- After the Cronus Zen and Zen Studio is updated, time to upload the script to the Cronus Zen! I have a video somewhat going over it on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/b0hKHsAgjag). 
1. Connect your Cronus Zen to your PC via the Prog port (the port on the right side of the Cronus Zen). Open up the Zen Studio Software!
2. Connect the Cronus Zen to your Console/PC of choice by connecting the port of the back side of Cronus Zen into a port on the console/PC. Check this [article](https://beta.cronusmax.com/choose-your-system) out to see if the system you are connecting to has extra steps!
3. Connect your Joy-Cons to the Cronus by pressing and holding the P2 button (Left blue button on the Cronus Zen). Once the Cronus starts flashing press and hold the Sync button on the Joy-Cons to pair them. They will rumble once connected
4. Head to the Compiler Menu on the Zen Studio and open up the .GPC file you wish to use.
5. Navigate to the top of the program to find the Compiler menu -> Build and Run.
6. The Device Monitor menu will appear and you're ready to go!

If you need more assistance check out the Manual on their website: [Set-up Cronus Zen](https://beta.cronusmax.com/setup-cronus-zen).
AND REMEMBER: The Joy-Con that used to be used for the Ring-Con is now in your Leg Strap while the Leg Strap Joy-Con is in your hands! It's a Cronus Zen issue(?) but the scripts function around it!

# FAQ
- Q: Is there anything else I need?
- A: Nope! Unlike the Titan Two you don't need Two more attachments to use it!

- Q: Why are my joycons switched? Will my Leg strap ruin my joycons?
- A: Unknown on my side. Maybe it's a cronus zen problem (remember it's $300 cheaper than the other option so expect some issues). As for the Right Joy-Con being in your legstrap just make sure you don't put the joystick in the mesh. The Joy-Con will still be secured and if you do end up putting the joystick into the mesh I have lines of code to make sure the drift doesn't affect your gameplay.

- Q: Do I need a Ring-Con to use this mod
- A: No! The Cronus Zen does not detect the Ring-Con so just hold the Joy-Con in your hand regular

- Q: Why does [insert button here] not press [insert another button here], it would make more sense "..."?
- A: These are template scripts! The cool thing about PC games is that you can changes the button inputs in-game. For Example, I did not mod the buttons on the joycon outside of locking the joystick. If you don't like the current button assignments you can remap them in-game or change the inputs in the script! GPC is pretty similar to C

- Q: Can I use/mod/update this for my projects?
- A: Yeah! Just credit me!

- Q: Will you be making more mods for the Titan Two?
- A: Not for a while! Although the Titan Two is wayyy better, they're never in stock and ends up being $400 to use so overall it's not worth it imo.
